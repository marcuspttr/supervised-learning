# supervised-learning
Using machine learning fundamentals to look through bank data and categorized potential loans.

# Overview
This problem applied alot of the basic ideas we had recently learned about machine learning.

- After generating the two data sets, one for training, one for testing. It removed our need to use a train_test_split function.
However the way they pulled the data made sense in a real-world setting, using the previous years bank data and testing against the first quarter of the next year (the intended target / use of this analysis).

-Used two different models to determine a better classifier, the logistic function and the random tree classifier.

-Applied a standard scaler to normalize the data to imrpove the logistic function and then did some basic analysis.

-I was interested in each model's precision and sensitivity beyond the models raw scores. I wrote the analysis in my document, but I was surprised how poor they faired and would be interested in running further models (perhaps KNN?)
